# Micro Weather Station

This code is a simple demonstration for Arduino to measure the
temperature and relative humidity and display the current values
on a tiny OLED display.

The code is tested on an Arduino Uno, but should be working on
other Arduino types and clones as well. The sensor is a DHT22,
which is connected to GND, 5V and Arduino pin 3. The OLED
display is a 4-pin version of the SSD1306, connected to GND and
5V too, and to the SDA and SCL pins of the Arduino.

All parts are widely available for just a few dollars.
